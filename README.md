## 📌 Overview

**Admin Pannel** is a clean, responsive, and extensible React frontend blueprint for building admin dashboards.  
It includes components, layout, routing, auth-ready hooks, and utilities tailored for managing users, analytics, and application settings.

This repository is meant as a starting point — plug it into any backend API and extend components or pages as needed.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Responsive dashboard layout (sidebar, topbar, content area)  
- Reusable UI components (tables, forms, modals, cards)  
- Route-based code splitting with Vite + React Router  
- State management readiness (hooks + context; plug in Redux / Zustand if needed)  
- Form handling patterns (react-hook-form ready)  
- Theme / design tokens (light & dark mode starter)  
- Example pages: Users, Settings, Analytics, Login  
- ESLint + Prettier opinionated config for consistent style

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React  
- **Bundler:** Vite (fast dev + HMR)  
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS — customize as needed)  
- **Routing:** react-router-dom  
- **Forms:** react-hook-form (optional)  
- **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky (recommended)  
- **Optional:** TypeScript (can be added), charts (Recharts / Chart.js)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js v16+  
- npm or yarn

### Install & Run

```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shivampandit79/admin-pannel.git
cd admin-pannel

# install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

# start dev server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
````

Open the URL shown in the console (default `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## ⚙️ Environment & Configuration

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and provide any API base URLs or feature toggles:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER=local
```

> All `VITE_` prefixed variables are exposed to the client — avoid storing secrets in frontend env files.

---

## 🧩 Example Pages & Flows

* **Login:** Simple email/password form (hook-ready for JWT tokens)
* **Dashboard:** KPI cards, recent activity, small charts
* **Users:** Paginated table with search, sort, edit & delete actions
* **Settings:** Editable app settings (key/value) with validations

Include sample API requests in `src/services/api.js` and replace with your backend endpoints.

---

## 🛡️ Authentication Pattern (Recommended)

This repo provides an **auth-ready** hook pattern:

* `AuthContext` exposes: `user, token, login(), logout(), isAuthenticated`
* `ProtectedRoute` component guards private pages
* Example flow:

  1. User submits login form
  2. `services/auth.js` calls `POST /auth/login`
  3. Token saved in secure cookie or localStorage (consider httpOnly cookie from backend)
  4. `AuthContext` fetches user profile and sets state

> For production, prefer httpOnly cookies + CSRF protection over localStorage tokens.

---

## 💅 Styling & Theming

* Tailwind config (recommended) with custom design tokens: colors, spacing, border-radius.
* Dark mode via `data-theme` or Tailwind `dark` strategy.
* Component tokens in `src/styles/tokens.js` to maintain consistency.

---

## ✅ Production Build

```bash
# build for production
npm run build
# serve the build locally
npm run preview
```

Configure your hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) to serve the `dist/` directory.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Add unit & integration tests with:

* **Jest** + **React Testing Library** for components
* **Cypress** or **Playwright** for end-to-end flows

Suggested npm scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "cypress open"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Utility Scripts & Dev Tools

* ESLint: `npm run lint`
* Format (Prettier): `npm run format`
* Husky pre-commit hooks to run `lint-staged` for changed files

---

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

* Replace the placeholder charts with **Recharts** for production analytics.
* Plug in **Redux** or **Zustand** if global state grows complex.
* Convert to **TypeScript** to improve maintainability (recommended for large dashboards).
* Add role-based access control (RBAC) for admin / super-admin routes.

---

## 📦 Deployment

Recommended hosts:

* **Vercel** — excellent for frontends (set build command to `npm run build` and output `dist`)
* **Netlify** — continuous deployment + redirects support
* **GitHub Pages** — for static deployments (single-page apps)
* **S3 + CloudFront** — for high-performance static hosting

Make sure to add redirects or rewrites for client-side routing (e.g., `_redirects` for Netlify).
